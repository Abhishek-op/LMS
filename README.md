I have build a library management system using Django where an admin can
perform CRUD ( create, read, update and delete) operations like

#### ● Add a Book
#### ● Update an entry of a book
#### ● Delete a book
#### ● Get all books

Develop web services using Python (Django Framework)
and front end technologies which can be used for the front end.

#### a) Insert admin details in tables.
#### b) An admin records should be unique based on email, which means
#### duplicates records should not be able to enter in DB.
